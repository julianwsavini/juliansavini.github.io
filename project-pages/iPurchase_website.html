            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>
                During my Co-Op with ISS Group, I was deeply involved in redesigning one of their flagship frontend products, <strong>iPurchase</strong>. The project aimed to modernize and enhance user interaction by leveraging Material Design Bootstrap (MDBootstrap) to create a responsive and dynamic interface.

            <h2>Technical Achievements</h2>
            <p>
                I developed the iPurchase frontend using a robust tech stack, focusing on responsive design, performance, and usability.
            </p>
            <h3>Tech Stack:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>HTML</li>
                <li>CSS (MDBootstrap)</li>
                <li>JavaScript</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                The frontend leveraged MDBootstrap's prebuilt components for a professional look while maintaining flexibility for customizations. I integrated features like collapsible navigation menus and interactive data tables to meet user requirements.

            <h2>UX Research & Critical Thinking</h2>
            <p>
                Beyond design, I conducted extensive UX research, engaging directly with clients to gather feedback and insights. This user-centric approach uncovered pain points and guided improvements in the interface.
            </p>
            <p>
                My ability to critically evaluate each iteration ensured that the final product surpassed expectations. By balancing creativity and analytical thinking, I helped transform iPurchase into a powerful tool tailored to user needs.

            <h2>Reflections</h2>
            <p>
                This experience was a cornerstone of my professional growth. It taught me the importance of iterative design and the value of stakeholder collaboration. Working part-time until May, I focused on understanding client needs and refining the interface to align with user goals.
            </p>
            <p>
                The emphasis on continuous improvement fostered a culture of excellence, and I am immensely proud of the contributions I made to this transformative project.
